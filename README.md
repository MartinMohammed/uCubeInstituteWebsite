# uCubeInstituteWebsite
A project given by my school. 


The uCube institute is an international institute for the study of dynamic heat flow (thermodynamics). The director of the institute is also my teacher in physics (high school). I volunteer to create a modern responsive web application for the institute. 

The web application is based on a Node/Express environment, uses a MySQL database, and will soon include a RESTful API to query research data as a visitor. The web application will soon be deployed in Google's App Engine (cloud service).The uCube institute is an international institute for the study of dynamic heat flow (thermodynamics).
